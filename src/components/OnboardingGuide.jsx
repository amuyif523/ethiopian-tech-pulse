            <GuideSection title="1. What are Git & GitHub?">
                <p>Think of Git as a "save" button for your code, but much more powerful. It lets you track every change you make. GitHub is a website that hosts your Git projects online. It's a place to store your code, collaborate with others, and show your work to the world. Itâ€™s your developer resume!</p>

            <GuideSection title="2. Creating Your Professional Profile">
                <p>Your GitHub profile is your professional identity. Make it count!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Profile Picture:</strong> Use a clear, professional photo of yourself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Name & Bio:</strong> Use your real name and write a short bio. Mention your school (e.g., "Student at AAiT") and your interests (e.g., "Aspiring Mobile Developer").</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Set your location to "Ethiopia" to appear on this leaderboard!</li>

            <GuideSection title="3. Your First Project: Pinning Your Best Work">
                <p>Even if you're a beginner, you can start a project. Create a "repository" for a simple school project or even just a document introducing yourself. The most important step is to "pin" your best projects to your profile. This is the first thing recruiters and collaborators will see.</p>
            </GuideSection>
            
             <GuideSection title="4. How to Contribute & Get Noticed">
                <p>The best way to get noticed is to contribute to open-source projects.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Find Ethiopian Projects:</strong> Explore the "Top Repositories" on this dashboard! Many local projects need help with documentation, fixing small bugs, or testing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fix a Typo:</strong> The easiest first contribution is often fixing a typo in a project's README file. It's a simple way to learn the workflow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> The green squares on your GitHub profile show your activity. Even a small contribution each week shows you are active and passionate. Keep your streak going!</li>
